                                    <p>I never believed in the whole "light at the end of the tunnel" folly where
                                        people, after experiencing near-death experiences, would startle awake in a cold
                                        sweat exclaiming, "I saw the light!"</p>
                                    <p>But here I am currently at this so-called "tunnel" facing a glaring light, when
                                        the last thing I remember was sleeping in my room (others call it the royal
                                        chamber).</p>
                                    <p>Did I die? If so, how? Was I assassinated?</p>
                                    <p>I don't remember wronging anyone, but then again, being a powerful public figure
                                        gave others all sorts of reasons to want me dead.</p>
                                    <p>Anyway…</p>
                                    <p>Since it didn't seem like I was going to wake up anytime soon, while I slowly
                                        gravitated towards this bright light, I might as well go along with it.</p>
                                    <p>The journey seemed to take an eternity; I half expected a choir of children to be
                                        singing an angelic hymn, beckoning me towards what I hoped would be heaven.</p>
                                    <p>Instead, my vision of everything around me turned into a blur of bright red as
                                        sounds assaulted my ears. When I tried to say something, the only sound that
                                        came out seemed to be a cry.</p>
                                    <p>The muffled voices became clearer and I made out a: "Congratulations Sir and
                                        Madam, he's a healthy boy."</p>
                                    <p>…Wait</p>
                                    <p>I guess normally, I should be thinking along the lines of "Shit, was I just born?
                                        Am I a baby now?"</p>
                                    <p>But strangely, the only thought that seemed to pop up in my mind was, 'So the
                                        bright light at the end of the tunnel is the light coming through into the
                                        female vag…'</p>
                                    <p>Haha... let's not think about it anymore.</p>
                                    <p>Assessing my situation in rational king-like manner, I noticed, first of all,
                                        that wherever this place was, I understood the language. That's always a good
                                        sign.</p>
                                    <p>Next, after slowly and painfully opening my eyes, my retinas were bombarded with
                                        different colors and figures. It took a bit of time for my infant eyes to get
                                        used to the light. The doctor, or so it seemed, in front of me had a
                                        not-so-appealing face with long, greying hair on both head and chin. I swear his
                                        glasses were thick enough to be bulletproof. The strange thing was, he wasn't
                                        wearing a doctor's gown nor were we even in a hospital room.</p>
                                    <p>I seemed to have been born from some satanic summoning ritual because this room
                                        was lit only by a couple of candles and we were on the floor over a bed of
                                        straw.</p>
                                    <p>I looked around and saw the female who pushed me out of her tunnel. Calling her
                                        mother should be fair. Taking a few more seconds to see what she looked like,
                                        I'd have to admit she's a beauty, but that might have been caused by my half
                                        blurry eyes. Rather than a glamorous beauty, I would better describe her as
                                        lovely, in a very kind and gentle sense, with distinct auburn hair and brown
                                        eyes. I couldn't help but notice her long eyelashes and perky nose that made me
                                        want to just cling to her. She just permeated this motherly feel. Is this why
                                        babies were attracted to their mothers?</p>
                                    <p>I peeled my face away and turned right to barely make out the person who I
                                        assumed was my father by the idiotic grin and teary eyes he gazed at me with.
                                        Immediately he said, "Hi little Art, I'm your daddy, can you say dada?" I
                                        glanced around to see both my mother and the house doctor (for all the
                                        certification he seemed to have), roll their eyes as my mother managed to scoff,
                                        "Honey, he was just born."</p>
                                    <p>I took a closer look at my father and I can see why my lovely mother was
                                        attracted to him. Besides the few loose screws he seemed to have by expecting a
                                        newborn to articulate a two-syllable word (I'm just going to give him the
                                        benefit of the doubt and think he said that out of the joy of becoming a
                                        father), he was a very charismatic-looking man with a cleanly shaven square jaw
                                        line that complimented his features. His hair, a very ashy brown color, seemed
                                        to be kept trim, while his eyebrows were strong and fierce, extending in a
                                        sword-like fashion meeting to a V shape. Yet, his eyes held a gentle quality,
                                        whether it was from the way his eyes drooped a bit at the end or from the deep
                                        blue, almost sapphire, hue that radiated from his irises.</p>
                                    <p>"Hmm, he isn't crying. Doctor, I thought newborns were supposed to cry when they
                                        are born." I heard my mother's voice.</p>
                                    <p>By the time I finished checking ou… I mean observing my parents; the wannabe
                                        doctor simply excused himself saying, "There are cases where the infant does not
                                        cry. Please continue resting for a couple of days Mrs. Leywin, and let me know
                                        if anything happens to Arthur, Mr. Leywin."</p>
                                    <p>The following couple of weeks after my journey out of the tunnel was a new kind
                                        of torture for me. I had little to no motor control over my limbs except being
                                        able to wave them around, and even that got tiring quickly. I realized all too
                                        grudgingly that babies don't really get to control their fingers all that much.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I don't know how to break it to you guys, but when you place your finger on a
                                        baby's palm, they don't grab it because they like you, they grab it because it's
                                        like getting hit in the funny bone; it's a reflex. Forget motor control, I can't
                                        even excrete my wastes at my discretion. I was not yet the master of my own
                                        bladder. It just… came out. Haa…</p>
                                    <p>On the bright side, one of the few perks that I became happily accustomed to was
                                        being breastfed by my mother.</p>
                                    <p>Don't get me wrong, I had no ulterior motives whatsoever. It's just that breast
                                        milk tasted a lot better than baby formula and has better nutritional value,
                                        okay? Er… please believe me.</p>
                                    <p>The Satanic demon-summoning place seemed to be my parent's room and from what I
                                        figured, the place that I was currently stuck in was, hopefully, a place in my
                                        world from the past, when electricity hadn't yet been invented.</p>
                                    <p>My mother quickly proved my hopes wrong as, one day, she healed a scratch on my
                                        leg from when my idiotic father bumped me against a drawer while swinging me
                                        around.</p>
                                    <p>No…Not like, band-aid and a kiss heal, but a full blown, shining light with a
                                        faint hum from her freaking hands type of healing.</p>
                                    <p>Where the hell am I?</p>
                                    <p>My mother, named Alice Leywin, and my father, named Reynolds Leywin, at least
                                        seemed to be good people, hell if not the best. I suspected my mother was an
                                        angel because I've never met such a kindhearted, warm person. While being
                                        carried on her back by a baby cradle-strap of some sort, I went with her to what
                                        she called a town. This town of Ashber was more of a glorified outpost, seeing
                                        that there were no roads or buildings. We walked on the main dirt trail where
                                        there were tents on both sides with various merchants and salesmen selling all
                                        sorts of things—from common, everyday necessities to things I couldn't help but
                                        raise a brow at, like weapons, armor, and rocks… shining rocks!</p>
                                    <p>The strangest thing that I couldn't seem to get used to was the people carrying
                                        weapons like it was a luxury designer bag. I witnessed a man of around 170cm
                                        carrying a gigantic war axe that was larger than him! Anyway, mother kept
                                        talking to me, probably to try to get me to learn the language faster, while
                                        shopping for the day's groceries, exchanging pleasantries with various people
                                        passing by or working in the booths. Meanwhile, my body turned against me once
                                        again, and I fell asleep… Damn this useless body.</p>
                                    <p>Sitting on the lap of my mother who was caressing me in her bosom, I was intently
                                        focused on my dad who was currently reciting a chant, which sounded like a
                                        prayer to the earth, for close to a good minute. I leaned in closer and closer,
                                        almost falling off my human seat while expecting some magical phenomenon, like
                                        an earthquake splitting the ground or a giant stone golem emerging. After what
                                        seemed like an eternity (trust me, for an infant who has the attention span of a
                                        goldfish, it was.) Three adult, human-sized boulders emerged from the ground and
                                        slammed against a nearby tree.</p>
                                    <p>What in the name of…that was it?</p>
                                    <p>I flailed my arms in anger, but my idiot father interpreted that into a "WOW" and
                                        had a big grin on his face saying, "Your daddy is awesome huh!"</p>
                                    <p>No, my father was a much better fighter. When he put on his two iron gauntlets,
                                        even I felt compelled to drop my underwear (or diaper) for him. With quick and
                                        firm movements that were surprising for his build, his fists carried enough
                                        force to break the sound barrier, but were fluid enough to not leave an opening.
                                        In my world, he would have been classed as a high-tier fighter, leading a squad
                                        of soldiers, but to me, he was my idiot father.</p>
                                    <p>For what I learned, this world seemed to be a fairly straightforward on filled
                                        with magic and warriors; where power and wealth decided one's rank in society.
                                        In that sense, it wasn't too different from my old world, except for the lack of
                                        technology and the slight difference between magic and ki.</p>
                                    <p>In my old world, wars had become an almost obsolete form of settling disputes
                                        between countries. Don't get me wrong, of course there were still smaller scale
                                        battles and armies were still needed for the safety of the citizens. However,
                                        disputes concerning the wellbeing of a country were based on either a duel
                                        between the rulers of the their country, limited to making use of ki and close
                                        combat weapons, or a mock battle between platoons, where limited firearms were
                                        allowed, for smaller disputes.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, Kings weren't the typical fat man sitting on the throne ignorantly
                                        commanding others, but had to be the strongest fighter to represent his or her
                                        country.</p>
                                    <p>Enough about that though.</p>
                                    <p>The currency in this new world seemed pretty straightforward from the exchanges
                                        my mother had with the merchants.</p>
                                    <p>Copper was the lowest form of currency, then silver, followed by gold. While I
                                        had yet to see anything costing as much as a gold coin, normal families seemed
                                        to be able to live off of a couple copper coins a day just fine.</p>
                                    <p>100 Copper = 1 Silver</p>
                                    <p>100 Silver = 1 Gold</p>
                                    <p>Everyday involved honing my new body, mastering the motor functions residing deep
                                        within me.</p>
                                    <p>That comfortable regimen soon changed.</p>
